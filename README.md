# KennyTopDownTanksReduxTankGame
Top down 2D tank game utilizing Kenny Top Down Tanks Redux game asset from https://www.kenney.nl/assets/topdown-tanks-redux.

I started this project from the idea of using one of Kenny's asset packs to make a fun 2D game. 
Halfway through the project, I got stuck. Thankfully the YouTube channel Sunny Valley Studio had a playlist of videos about creating a tank game with the same pack of assets. I followed along that series and implemented many of his techniques and features into my project.
